# Miscellaneous scripts and such

Repo of scripts and such that in itself isn't repo worthy.

## [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) V1

### [AutoCAD binds](AutoHotkey%20V1/AutoCAD%20binds.ahk)

Bind keys to specific commands that are used 90% of the time for 2D sketching on AutoCAD.

#### [BoxDwgChars](AutoHotkey%20V1/BoxDwgChars.ahk)

Type box drawing characters using numpad.

#### [ChaoticKeyboard](AutoHotkey%20V1/ChaoticKeyboard.ahk)

Typing with random letterlike symbols.

#### [Drawing](AutoHotkey%20V1/Drawing.ahk)

Template script to use [gInk](https://github.com/geovens/gInk) with a mouse or a drawing tablet and binding hotkeys for specific programs when using a drawing tablet (because UI's aren't that great and simply coding what I want is easier).

#### [LaTeX shortcuts](AutoHotkey%20V1/LaTeX%20shortcuts.ahk)

Keybinds to insert general LaTeX symbols&commands.

#### [mousePosColorTooltip](AutoHotkey%20V1/mousePosColorTooltip.ahk)

Handy script to see which pixels your cursor is at, color of the pixel and copy those into the clipboard.

#### [TauonGlobalHotkeys](AutoHotkey%20V1/TauonGlobalHotkeys.ahk)

Media control using Tauon's HTTP API, also shows tooltips to mitigate the app not having notifications.

#### [timer](AutoHotkey%20V1/timer.ahk)

A simple always on top, resettable timer.

## Miscellaneous

[All-In-One Config](Miscellaneous/autoexec.cfg)

Config file for Dota2 that encompasses most of what you'd need or want.

## Style Sheets

### [Clean DU](Style%20Sheets/Clean%20DU.styl)

Style written in Stylus style sheet language, aiming to fix what's broken and improve on in [Duzce University](https://duzce.edu.tr/) pages.

I'd recommend you to get it through [here](https://userstyles.world/style/18174/clean-du) using a userstyles add-on (e.g [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)).
This is just here for archival purposes.

### [Minimizer](Style%20Sheets/Minimizer.css)

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) snippet that tries to minimize & simplify every single aspect of the editor UI, in a hacky way.
